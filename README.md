Simplistic approach to handle Rohitab API Monitor's breaking of process notifications on Windows 8.1/Server 2012 and later due to its inbuilt process notification driver not being updated.
MAke sure 32-bit or 64-bit API monitor is already running and is listing running processes

Use AutoAttachAPIMon_x64 c*.exe to monitor all new 64-bit processes matching the wildcard pattern
Use AutoAttachAPIMon_x86 c*.exe to monitor all new 32-bit processes matchingi the widcard pattern
